Fake News Detection Using AI

This project aims to detect fake news using machine learning techniques by analyzing text content. It classifies news articles as real or fake to prevent misinformation.

Features

* Detects fake news from text data
* Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Machine Learning and/or Deep Learning based models
* Trained on labeled datasets of real and fake news
* Easy-to-use prediction script for testing new inputs

Tech Stack

* Python
* scikit-learn / TensorFlow / Keras
* Pandas
* NumPy
* NLTK / spaCy
* Flask (for web interface, if applicable)

How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection-ai.git
   cd fake-news-detection-ai
   

2. Install dependencies:

   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

3. Train the model:

   
   python train_model.py
   

4. Run predictions:

   
   python predict.py
   

   You can input a custom news headline or article to test.

Dataset

The project uses a labeled dataset containing real and fake news articles, such as the [Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset) from Kaggle.

Model

* Text data is vectorized using TF-IDF or word embeddings.
* Classifiers: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, or LSTM.
* Accuracy and performance metrics are tracked for each model.

Applications

* Social media monitoring
* Journalism and media validation
* Education against misinformation
